          An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in
          horror.

        <h4>
          “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
          most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others
          may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't
          necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

          Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by
          Brandon Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is
          recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

                  When I discover a film I feel is really special in some way, I
                  usually drag as many people to the theater as possible to see
                  it with me before it’s banished to the streaming realm
                  forever. I’m always excited by the challenge of choosing
                  people I’m sure will enjoy it as much as I do, but I’m not
                  always right.

                <p>
                  With <em>Under the Skin (2013)</em>, I had about a 50% success
                  rate with people either really loving it or hating it. With
                  <em>Let the Right One In (2008)</em>, I hit a near 100%
                  success rate with the only complaint being having to read
                  subtitles (which is clearly not a complaint about the movie
                  and says more about the viewer). With Blue Ruin I hit my first
                  home run (did I use that sportsball metaphor correctly?). Now,
                  I’ve only shared it with about 4–5 people, but across the
                  board everyone really loved the movie.

                  Director Jeremy Saulnier needs to write the handbook for
                  making great films on a small budget. The budget for this film
                  was around $420,000 , which is just remarkable. I’ve never
                  made a film, but this just seems like an impossible challenge.
                  I’d love to know how they pulled it off. I’m so glad they did.
